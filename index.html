    <h2>Artist Bio</h2>
    <p>
      Victoria Ku is a stained glass artist whose work explores light as an atmospheric and symbolic force. Working under the moniker Celestial Glasswitch, she creates contemporary stained glass pieces that draw from ritual forms, architectural thresholds, and celestial imagery.

Her practice is informed by a tension between fragility and control: glass as a material that is both unforgiving and enduring. Each piece is constructed to change with light and time, activating space rather than serving as ornament. The work often references portals, lunar forms, and quiet symbolic geometry, inviting prolonged contemplation rather than narrative interpretation.

Ku approaches stained glass as a medium of presence—shaping mood, stillness, and reverence within contemporary interiors. She accepts a limited number of private commissions alongside personal bodies of work.

She lives and works in California.
